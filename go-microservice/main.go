// Go Microservice module provides a reusable Dagger pipeline for building, testing,
// and validating Go-based microservices in CI/CD workflows.
//
// This module was scaffolded using `dagger init` and designed to serve as a flexible
// DevOps automation unit for Go projects. It integrates static analysis, unit testing,
// code coverage reporting, and security scanning in a streamlined containerized pipeline.
//
// The primary function orchestrates the workflow by accepting source directories,
// test file paths, linter configurations, and other runtime options. It ensures
// clean and consistent execution environments for Go toolchain operations using Dagger
// containers and caches.
//
// Features include:
// - Static analysis using golangci-lint with customizable configuration
// - Unit test execution with optional code coverage reports
// - Modular and composable design, suitable for use in monorepos or multi-service platforms
// - Security scanning with tools like `gosec` (planned)
//
// This module can be invoked via the Dagger CLI or imported into another Dagger pipeline,
// making it ideal for use in CI runners, GitOps systems, or developer workstations.
//
// Future improvements may include:
// - Dependency vulnerability scanning integration (e.g., `govulncheck` or `trivy`)
// - Auto-formatting and import validation (`goimports`, `gofmt`)
// - Multi-platform build support for releasing binaries
// - Integration with release pipelines for tagging, changelogs, and artifact publishing
//
// This documentation serves as both an overview and implementation reference
// for integrating Go microservice workflows using Dagger.
