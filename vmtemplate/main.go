// Vmtemplate module provides a workflow for managing VM template builds using
// Packer and Vault, optionally driven by Git-hosted configurations.
//
// This module is designed for infrastructure automation involving dynamic VM
// image generation in vSphere environments. It supports building templates via
// Packer with secure secret injection from Vault (AppRole or token-based),
// optionally sourcing the build configuration from a Git repository.
//
// The primary function RunVsphereWorkflow orchestrates this process. It clones
// a Packer configuration from Git or uses a provided local directory, then
// invokes the Bake function to initialize and optionally build the template.
// Secrets such as vSphere credentials or config values are fetched from Vault
// and injected securely into the Packer process.
//
// This module is well-suited for use within Dagger-based CI/CD pipelines or
// automated image delivery systems. Its integration with Vault ensures secrets
// never touch the disk, while Git integration makes the workflow reproducible.
//
// Future enhancements planned include:
// - Creating and validating test VMs from newly built templates
// - Running Ansible-based verification and post-provisioning logic
// - Performing automated template promotion and cleanup
// - Supporting versioned GitOps-style workflows for image release
//
// This documentation provides an overview of the current implementation and
// serves as a foundation for extending the VM lifecycle automation further.
